-> When we declare a variable inside a class but outside any method, it is called a class variable in Python.
->self.length and self.breadth are instance variables specific to each instance of the class.
->Class variables can be accessed from within the class using cls.ClassVariable, ClassName.ClassVariable, or instance.ClassVariable.
->There are two ways of accessing class variables from inside class method- 
    cls.ClassVariable  ClassName.ClassVaraiable 
->There is only one way to access class variables from stac method- â€¢ClassName.ClassVariable

'''
When a variable is declared outside any method 
but inside the class, it is generally referred to 
as a "class variable" or "static variable."
 This variable is shared among all instances of the class.

However, if you initialize or modify this variable 
inside the __init__ method, which is called
 when creating an instance of the class, 
 it becomes an "instance variable" specific to each instance.
