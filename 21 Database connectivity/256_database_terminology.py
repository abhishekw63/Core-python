->Database is stored in the form of tables
Relation: 
    • It is also said as RDBMS ( Relational database management system )because data is stored as a form of relation( table) 
    •Data is entered in the table as per schema 
    • Firstly we have to design the structure of a table 
Fields : 
    •Columns are called as fields.
Record :
    •Row of the table is said as record or also said as tuple 
Primary Key :
    • It is the unique column with no null value . It will be easy to search using primary key( which will not have any duplicate value ) 
    • If you want to know the name or department you can search it by using primary key .
Relationship : 
    One table which is referring to the other table 
Foreign : 
    • Two table have the relation of one foreign key and one primary key .
    • Foreign key inside the table can be primary key in another table vice versa.
Constraint : 
    •Not null is the constraint ( any row should not be null ) unique is constraint and primary key is also constraint because in table Dept number should be present in another table Deptno.
    We can only use the table if the values present in the table 1 should be present in table 2.
